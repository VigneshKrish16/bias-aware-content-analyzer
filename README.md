# ðŸ§  Bias-Aware Content Analysis Platform

A Flask-based web application that retrieves, clusters, and analyzes textual content for potential biases, diversity, and fairness. The system uses advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to provide **Bias Inclusivity Quality (BIQ)**, **Content Fairness Score (CFS)**, and **Content Diversity Score (CDS)** for the retrieved documents.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Bias-Aware Retrieval** â€“ Retrieves relevant documents from domain-specific datasets while accounting for potential biases.
- **Content Clustering** â€“ Groups similar documents using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for better diversity analysis.
- **Bias Metrics Calculation** â€“ Calculates Inclusivity, Diversity, and Fairness scores to evaluate content objectively.
- **Multi-Domain Support** â€“ Works with `healthcare`, `finance`, `education`, and `general` domains.
- **Interactive API** â€“ Exposes an `/analyze` endpoint to receive queries and return results in JSON format.
